A recipe app that will be used to learn new design patterns. Eventually this will become a commercial product, currently it is a UI/UX texing ground. No real set direction or path, just a vague end goal idea, just the way I like it. 

The end goal idea is a low carb recipe creator/sharing/progress tracking app. Eventually the recipe cards will conform to the pin standards of Pinterest so created recipes can be shared to pinterest, which will allow me to link traffic back to my app also it will take care of recipe card format as the pin format has already been proven successful from a UX point of view.

Likely features in the future will be various social "hooks" to all the most popular social media platforms. Comments/Suggestions on recipe cards for the recipes that a user creates, other users that view these recipes can interact socially via the recipe card. Integration with instacart on some level and/or other online shopping outlets, including Amazon (affiliate commission ;)). A "hot or not" like feature where recipe cards are shown one at a time, the user can swip right to stash a link to the card in their recipe book or they can swip left to pass.

Many of the compenents being developed can and will be used in similar products.

A LONG way to go.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
